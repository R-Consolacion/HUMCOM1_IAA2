		The night Quin Kincaid takes her Oath, <br> 
		she will become what she has trained to be her entire life.<br> 
		She will become a Seeker. This is her legacy, and it is an honor. <br>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 10px;" > 
		As a Seeker, Quin will fight beside her two <br/>
		closest companions, Shinobu and John, to protect the <br/>
		weak and the wronged. Together they will stand for light in  <br/>
		a shadowy world.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 10px;" >
		And she'll be with the boy she loves - <br/>
		who's also her best friend. <br/>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 10px;" >
		But the night Quin takes her Oath, <br/>
		everything changes. <br/>
	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 10px;" >
		Being a Seeker is not what she thought. <br/>
		Her family is not what she thought. <br/>
		Even the boy she loves is not who she thought. <br/>
	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 10px;" >
		And now it's too late to walk away. <br>
